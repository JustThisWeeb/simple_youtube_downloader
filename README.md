# Simple youtube downloader

exactly what it sounds like. A script that lets you download youtube playlists and videos.
One small thing to note is that you do need to make the playlists either public or unlisted. 

Another thing to note is that when you start the script for the first time you actually need to type "dir change" as an input and then put the directory you want your videos to be saved in there. Afterwards you can change it using the same input.
